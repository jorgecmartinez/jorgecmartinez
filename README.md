👋 Hi, I’m @jorgecmartinez

I'm an industrial engineer specialised in Energy Markets from a technical, economical and political background (At the final stages of the PhD).

Currently I’m working on Local Energy Markets. In particular, trends on how these LEMs can be put in practice: decentralisation, flexibility and aggregation.

🌱 My main language is Python.
However, other languages can be used as well: C++, .NET and .GO.

💞️ Please, take a look to my public repositories. I’m open to collaborate and solve any question that may arise.
